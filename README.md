# Hi, I'm Rahil 👋  
**Applied AI / Full-Stack Engineer** — real-time systems, LLM workflows, and database-backed products.

Short bio: I’m a CS master’s student at NC State who enjoys building end-to-end AI products with measurable impact, from streaming systems to data-backed search and evaluation pipelines.

Highlights: 
- 🚀 Orchestrated **LiveKit WebRTC + LLM** interview flows over WebSockets; supported **30+ concurrent sessions** (demo load)
- 🎙️ Integrated **STT/TTS streaming** with async processing; achieved **sub-second transcription latency** (typical demo audio)
- ✅ Built automated **LLM evaluation + scoring + badges**; reduced manual review effort by **60%** (internal pilot)
- 🔎 Shipped **Postgres vector search** pipeline; **top-k <200ms** on **50k+ chunks** (local benchmarking)

## 💼 Internship Experience
### Cogbee — AI Engineer Intern (May 2025 – Jul 2025)
- Built Python microservices to orchestrate LiveKit WebRTC sessions and LLM prompt-loop dialogues over WebSockets, supporting **30+ concurrent interview sessions** (demo load).  
- Integrated OpenAI STT/TTS with async streaming I/O for real-time turn-taking and **sub-second transcription latency** (typical demo audio).  
- Implemented automated LLM evaluation (structured Q&A, composite scoring, soft-skill badges), reducing manual review effort by **60%** (internal pilot).  

### AVI - Web Solutions — Python Intern Developer (Jan 2024 – Jun 2024)
- Built a multilingual document processing pipeline (conversion → chunking → embeddings) using Python, Pandoc, and LangChain.  
- Stored vectors in PostgreSQL to enable **top-k semantic search <200ms** on **50k+ chunks** (local benchmarking).  

### Vonly - Data Analytics Solutions — Software Engineer Intern (May 2023 – Jul 2023)
- Built interactive Redash dashboards for 10+ stakeholders, cutting report turnaround from hours to minutes.  
- Developed a C# + Python metadata consolidation system, reducing duplicate/incorrect mappings by **25%** (internal QA).  

### DAIICT — Teaching Assistant (Aug 2023 – Jan 2024)
- Led weekly tutorials for 120+ students, graded 300+ submissions, and improved grading consistency with a clear rubric.

## 🧠 How I build
- I optimize for **measurable outcomes** (latency, throughput, time saved)
- Comfortable with **async + streaming** systems (WebRTC, WebSockets, real-time pipelines)
- Strong testing habits: **unit/integration + API testing**, clean interfaces, predictable behavior
- Practical debugging mindset: isolate failure modes, log intelligently, fix root causes
- Product + collaboration oriented: ship iteratively, document decisions, align with stakeholders
